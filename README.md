valuable dataset for exploration.

 • The background is rooted in the understanding that traditional methods of 
manual analysis are increasingly insufficient to harness the vast volume of 
textual data.

 • The purpose is to contribute to the evolving landscape of data analytics by 
employing advanced unsupervised learning techniques to extract valuable 
knowledge from unstructured textual data related to the domain of films.

## Aim
 • Leverage clustering algorithms on textual data related to the domain of 
films, specifically focusing on clustering movie overviews based on 
similarities in their textual descriptions in order to to extract meaningful 
insights from the dataset
