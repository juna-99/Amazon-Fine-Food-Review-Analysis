## Background 
 • The increasing volume of online reviews has made it challenging for businesses to extract meaningful information.
 
• Sentiment analysis offers a solution by automating the process of understanding and categorizing sentiments expressed in user reviews.

## Problems
 • Addressing missing values, duplicates, and class imbalance.

 • Implementing effective text preprocessing for accurate sentiment classification.

 • Training and evaluating the performance of machine learning models to predict sentiment

## Solution Designs

### Data Cleaning
 •  Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing class imbalance to ensure the integrity of the data.

 ### Text Preprocessing
 •  HTML tag removal, punctuation, and digit removal, stop word elimination, and stemming, optimizing the ttext data for sentiment analysis.

### Model Training
 •  Three robust classifiers, namely Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes were trained on the TF-IDF transformed data.

 ### Model Evaluation
 •  Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, ROC-AUC curves and detailed classification reports, ensuring the reliability of sentiment predictions
